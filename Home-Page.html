          <h2>I Am</h2>
          <p>
            ... a father of 1, an avid lover of real estate & development, and
            patron of the arts. For the past 8+ years, I have been achieving in
            the world of medicine & pharmacology. During the pandemic, I stepped
            away from all and underwent a Sabbatical and decided to pursue my
            true love. Innovation, technology, and creation.
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <p>
            ... a creative at heart. I began life's journey as a trained
            pianist from the age of 4 and later learned to play over 15+
            instruments starting off as a music major in undergrad. Some time
            later I changed over to the field of medicine and have been taught
            how to analyze and problem solve from different perspectives that
            most wouldn't consider. During my post grad education, I was then
            taught how to be immensely maticulate. We were taught that if a
            mistake got passed us then it could feasibly effect our license and
            livelihood.  My past educational & work experiences emphasized cross functionality and collaboration to create simple solutions to solve complex problems efficiently.  In my last pharmacy role, I worked in our records and data department handling hundreds of functions a day.  That role gave me the confidence to fully pursue a new endeavor in tech.
          </p>

          <p>
          ... a lover of arts, creativity, and advancment outside of my career.  I love going to hear live music, art galleries, broadway, and have a new interest in fashion.  On the opposite end, I absolutely enjoy admiring and learning about real estate development.  I can spend hours researching upcoming projects, approvals, and walk around Chicago admiring architecture.  I have a strong desire to develop projects of my own, incorporating tech into the process.  For absolute relaxation I enjoy chess, going to car shows, and trying out new restaurants.
