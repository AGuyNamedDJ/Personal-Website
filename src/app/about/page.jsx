          <p className="leading-relaxed text-neutral-800">
            I am Dalron J. Robertson, a researcher, engineer and creative problem solver in the life sciences. My early work in the arts taught me how structured discipline and creative insight spark innovation. Through composing music and writing books I learned to build systems that combine precision with expressive purpose.
          </p>
          <p className="leading-relaxed text-neutral-800 mt-2">
            My training spans biomedical science, clinical pharmacology and software engineering. As lead graduate researcher I guided a team of sixteen in evaluating phytochemicals for therapeutic use. We built structural models, ran molecular docking simulations and conducted bioinformatics analyses to identify the most promising candidates. That work earned second place at my universityâ€™s annual research symposium.
          </p>
          <p className="leading-relaxed text-neutral-800 mt-2">
            I am currently developing a computational framework that ingests new biological data as it emerges, refines its models over time and scales to address diverse research challenges. I believe creation is a core human calling, to ask meaningful questions, design with care and build systems that deliver real impact. My clinical training, engineering expertise and commitment to thoughtful innovation equip me to advance scientific discovery.
