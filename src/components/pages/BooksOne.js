                <p>Dr. Jade King is a woman at war—not just with the powerful tech conglomerates redefining healthcare but with herself. As artificial intelligence threatens to dominate the field she holds dear, Jade finds herself caught in a battle to protect the soul of medicine while confronting her own fears of inadequacy in a rapidly changing world.

                <p>Navigating the chaos of innovation, Jade must also face her deepest vulnerabilities: a budding romance with the brilliant but enigmatic Devon Rosenburgh, her lingering doubts about her ability to make a difference, and the relentless pull between ambition and authenticity.

As Jade fights to bridge the divide between cutting-edge innovation and the warmth of human touch, she discovers that healing is as much about the heart as it is about the mind.
