Core pages (the only items in the main navigation)
	1.	Home – the scroll-driven narrative we discussed: cinematic hero, “Now” snapshot, research highlight, ventures grid, discreet footer.
	2.	About – a curated story rather than a résumé dump. One page that combines:
	•	a concise bio paragraph,
	•	a timeline ribbon (milestones, publications, degrees),
	•	a single portrait photo that feels editorial.
	3.	Work – everything under your professional umbrella, split by tabs or jump links:
	•	NaS & Research – current focus, papers, infrastructure vision;  
	•	Ventures – brief cards for Robertson Foundation, Zeta, RBRSN, etc.;  
	•	Creative Studio – photography gallery, film/YouTube highlights, art & design showcase, music embeds;  
	4.	Writing – a clean index of long-form pieces: journal essays, book excerpts, op-eds.  Each article opens as its own route (/writing/<slug>). This replaces the maze of “journals,” “books,” “booksOne,” etc.
	5.	Connect – the single call-to-action page: short contact form, social links, download-CV button. This keeps e-mails off the homepage footer and channels outreach into one funnel.

Satellite routes (linked only from inside their section)
	•	Individual article pages (/writing/the-cost-of-clarity)
	•	Legal (Terms + Privacy) – one combined page in the footer, out of the main nav.
	•	Site Map generated automatically, but invisible to most users.

## Home Page Narrative Flow

1. **Cinematic Hero**  
   Full‑viewport video loop (Chicago skyline at dawn or lab shot) that freezes into a still once scroll begins.

2. **Latest Ribbon**  
   A slender, high‑contrast strip with 2–3 auto‑rotating tiles (new NaS pre‑print, fresh essay, recent photo set) to signal live activity.

3. **“Now” Snapshot**  
   Apple‑style copy block (max two sentences) explaining what Dalron is building this quarter. Light background for easy reading.

4. **NaS & Research Highlight**  
   Palette flips to dark; a drifting 3‑D helix anchors the block. Click anywhere to jump to NaS inside the Work page.

5. **Ventures Grid**  
   Four cards glide up with the Chanel perspective tilt—Robertson Foundation, RBRSN, Zeta, etc.—inviting deeper exploration.

6. **Creative Studio Montage**  
   Dark, gallery‑like section of full‑bleed photography that shifts a few degrees on scroll; muted soundtrack snippets play on hover (sound off by default).

7. **Contact Strip**  
   Narrow band: “Let’s build something extraordinary,” matte‑gold **Connect** button, discreet social icons.

8. **Dark‑Mode Footer**  
   Permanent graphite footer anchors the page, mirroring Chanel’s luxury finish.

This sequence moves visitors from timeless brand presence to real‑time updates, alternating light and dark palettes to keep attention fresh without visual chaos.

## Design References – Apple Play‑book Applied to Each Page

### Home  
Cinematic hero video à la MacBook Pro launch page. Each subsequent block (Now, NaS teaser, Ventures grid, Creative Studio montage) owns the full viewport, then yields with soft parallax—mirroring Apple’s section‑by‑section scroll narrative.

### About  
Editorial layout inspired by Apple’s Environmental Progress Report microsites: a centered, narrow content column framed by full‑bleed chapter dividers. Includes a single portrait intro followed by a vertical timeline ribbon in floating white cards.

### Work  
Three dark tiles—NaS & Research, Ventures, Creative Studio—echo the product‑family strip on Apple.com. Each tile brightens and tilts ~3° on hover, then scroll‑jumps to its section.

### Writing  
Grid of uniform article cards mimicking Apple Newsroom. Fade‑in with 100 ms stagger as you scroll; reader view is minimalist, black text on off‑white, no sidebars.

### Connect  
Low‑contrast graphite bar, inspired by Apple’s footer CTA band. Compact contact form left, social icons center, matte‑gold outlined “Download CV” button right. Entire unit sits above the fold for instant access.

## Design References – Chanel Parallax & Micro‑Motion

**Parallax Depth (signature Chanel move)**  
- Subtle scroll‑linked perspective shift (~3°) on desktop only.  
- No jarring offsets; motion should feel like holding a printed page at a slight angle.

### Where we’ll use it
- **Home** – Ventures grid cards tilt as they scroll into view, echoing Chanel product shots.  
- **Work → Creative Studio** – Hero photo tilts while a thin matte‑gold rule slides in from the opposite edge.  
- **About** – Full‑bleed break images gently scale to 105 % on scroll, adding depth between timeline bands.

### Additional Chanel cues
- Serif headlines with micro‑letter‑spacing for **Writing** article cards.  
- Button underline that slides in 0.25 s on hover (**Connect** page).

### Section Block Rhythm & Dark‑Mode Footer  
Inspired by Chanel’s dark footer and OpenAI’s night palette, the site will alternate light and dark section blocks for visual cadence. The final footer across all pages lives in dark mode (graphite background, neutral‑100 text), anchoring the scroll and mirroring Chanel’s luxury cues without committing the entire site to dark mode.

## Design References – Steve Jobs Archive “Tangible Editorial” Touch

**Key cue**  
- Photorealistic, slightly dimensional objects (e.g., book mock‑ups) that anchor a section and invite scrolling, evoking the Archive’s physical‑book hero.

### Where we’ll use it
- **Writing** – Page opens with a realistic 3‑D book cover of your latest title; scroll nudges the book upward while the first paragraph fades in below.  
- **About** – Each milestone in the timeline can be paired with a floating artifact (lab notebook, vintage prescription pad) rendered as a subtle 3‑D card to reinforce the tactile narrative.

Motion should remain understated—gentle lift or shadow change on scroll, no hard rotations—so it meshes with the Apple and Chanel rhythms already defined.
